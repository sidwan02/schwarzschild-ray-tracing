# schwarzschild-ray-tracing

This project is meant to perform Schwarzschild Ray Tracing based on user choices and parameters. 
The user may simulate how light bends around a blackhole using rays emitted from sources at the desired positions at custom angles or by choosing a pre-made setup.

How to Run
----------
To run the Ray Tracing, clone the repository and enter your parameters in [input.txt](./input.txt). Then, run the file [ray_tracing.py](./ray_tracing.py) to see the result.
